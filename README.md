# DipIt

Welcome to the DipIt project - a simple project for implementing a car gear knob pushbutton that toggle between high and low beam lights, by using a 3D printed gear knob and a Arduino brain (Seed Studio XIAO).

**DISCLAIMER:**

Please consider this project as an prototype - implement on your own risk. 
Make sure voltage supply is fused and isolate all wires and connectors to avoid short circuits.
The automotive electrical environment is noisy and harsh for electronics. I did add some protective elements to the design - but not according to automotive standards. 
I rather tried to keep design as simple as possible to keep cost and complexity low. Due to this, I cannot guarantee a long happy DipIt life - but who knows?!
The MIT license applies both to software and hardware.

You find the required PCB parts on the schematic, in addition you will need a standard automotive 5-pin "changeover" relay.

I hope someone finds this project interesting and implements it - in that case I would love to know!
